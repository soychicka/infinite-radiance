= Carousel

A customizable infinitely rotating banner that can be used standalone or as part of a Radiant installation.

This repository includes
 * Rotating image carousel based on "Infinite Carousel" Version 1.2.2 by CatchMyFame.com (http://www.catchmyfame.com/catchmyfame-jquery-plugins/), as customized by @soychicka and @macboypro for Blazing Cloud (http://www.blazingcloud.net), 2009.
 * Radius tag implementation by Anna Billstrom for Blazing Cloud (http://www.blazingcloud.net), 2009
 * GUI implementation by @soychicka for GoodCubed, 2010.


Basics:
To display items in the carousel, create an unordered list containing the image and a p-tag for any text you wish to display in the text box.  

bc. 
For Radiant installations, this is handled by the radius "carousel_image" tag,  

bc. <r:carousel_image src="[path to image, i.e. http://localhost/images/1.jpg]" caption="The image" />

To Install as a Radiant extension
1. In your vendor/extensions directory, enter:
git clone git@github.com:soychicka/radiant-carousel-extension.git carousel

2. OPTIONAL: You can copy images to a radiant public image directory by typing, in your Radiant root:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:copy_images
Or, you can use MediaMaid to get links to your images. 
Or, you can hand-code in the links to your images.

3. (back to required steps) In your radiant root directory, enter:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:update

4. In the Radiant Admin UI interface, use the following tags:
<r:carousel>
<r:carousel_image src="[path to image, i.e. http://localhost/images/1.jpg]" caption="The image" />
... iterate through as many carousel images as you want.
</r:carousel>

5. Lastly, make sure the pages that carry the carousel have a layout, that includes the following links in the header (in this order):
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/jquery.infinitecarousel.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/carousel.js"></script>
<LINK REL=StyleSheet HREF="/stylesheet/carousel.css" TYPE="text/css" MEDIA=screen>
